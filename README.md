# Dropbox Photo Sync

**Dropbox Photo Sync** is an Android app that allows you to sync selected photos on your cell phone with Dropbox. It uses Dropbox's Android Sync API and has been written as a pet project to try out the API. The inspiration came from wanting to make photo transfer between my cell phone and laptop easier. Normally I have to find a cable to connect my phone with my laptop to transfer my photos, or I have to select individual photos and select "share to" -> "dropbox" for each of them, or I am only able to sync all my photos automatically in the background. As I wasn't happy with all these options, I wrote my own syncing app :)
